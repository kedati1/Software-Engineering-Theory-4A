# How to push changes to Git Hub    -     Avoid pushing work directly onto the Main branch
  Once you have changes you wish to submit, Open Fork and press "Local Changes" on the top left. Make sure the group project is what Fork is focusing on.
  
  Click on any file in the unstaged window and check to see if the changes on the local machine are correct. (This is where you can discard specific changes that may have been accidental)
  
  Once happy, Double Click the files in the "Unstaged" window to move them to Staged
  
  Give the commit a subject (The title of whats been changed) and a description (will probably help us out later on for documentation purposes)
  
  Click the bottom left drop down arrow and select "Commit and Push"
  
  Note: If you committed and didnt select "Commit and Push", then u can click the push arrow in the top left.

# Refreshing Local Project
